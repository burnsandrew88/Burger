# EAT DA BURGER APPLICATION

## This is a node based application that uses Express.js, mysql, express.handblebars, while functioning as an MVC.

## Within the application, the user will have the option to add a Burger to the already existing burger menu that is stored on mysql and allow the user to update the database on the client side. The user has two options: They can create a burger and they can decide to eat it. Once they make these decisions, the backend code/logic takes care of the tasks by updating the mysql database.
